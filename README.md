Name: Joshua Becker
 Project Title: Advertisements
 Project Stack: MERN
 GitHub Repo Link: https://github.com/joshuabecker91/personalproject

 Project Description: 
    Users who want to market their brand can enroll in paid advertising by creating ads and managing their ad campaigns (creating, reading, updating, and deleting). 
    They can manage all their advertisements from the campaign dashboard. There will be a form to create a new campaign as well as one to edit a current campaign.
    The dashboard will show the title of the campaign and the web address that they are routing people to when they click on the ad. 
    These advertisements are rendered in a side banner when visitors are searching the web (via bonus search engine api feature).
    The application will use React, Express, Node, MongoDB, Mongoose, Axios. Deployed on AWS EC2 (bonus).
 
New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: 
- Getting more proficient with building MERN projects altogether, and writing clean efficient code.
- Getting more proficient and solidifying my understanding with the backend on MERN.
- Practicing my front end design / styling skills and therefore making something impressive for portfolio.
- Learning how to do Login and Registration (bonus feature per project requirements) for MERN stack.
- Learning / imporoving my skills with working with APIs. Would like to use one or two in this project.


Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2)
- Full project runs all basic app functionality with nodeman and npm start meaning the server.js file and all the folder structure is set up.
- Clean code written for all CRUD functionality for the advertisements. config, controllers, models, routes all mostly complete.
- Model is created with all the necessary fields and validations.
- Front end pages/components are built however more styling may still be needed.
- Search Engine API is able to fetch data, might need more styling work but functional (bonus feature).


Week 2 Features (to show at the first office hour/lecture of Week 3)
- Dashboard complete, create and edit forms complete, CRUD functionality 100% working, API working.
- Styling is complete and project is ready to deploy.
- Login and Registration (bonus).


Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...)
- Visiters can view these advertisements in a side banner when they are searching the web via search engine API (bonus).
- Login and Registration for users to create their own campaigns (bonus).
- Users can pause or resume a campaign and shows the current status of the ad in the dashboard (bonus).
- Users can see a count of how many times their ad has been served meaning clicked on (bonus).
- When someone clicks on the pay per click ad, the price/bid for that click is added to a total amount that the client owes for the paid advertising (bonus).
- Advertisements are rendered in the search engine banner with preference to the highest bidder or math.random or some combination/something similar (bonus).
- Users can view the balance that they owe and process a payment via API to reduce their "balance due" for the paid advertising (bonus).
- Learning how to use useContext.
